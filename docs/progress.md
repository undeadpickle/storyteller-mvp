## Notes and Observations

- Successfully configured ESLint (`eslint.config.js`) to handle ESM (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `eslint.config.js`) and CJS (`tailwind.config.js`) files correctly.
- Resolved issues related to `no-console`, `no-explicit-any`, `no-unused-vars`, `no-undef` (for `process`), and `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`.
- Debugging utilities (logger, performance monitor, debug hook, error boundary, debug panel) are set up and tested (verified via `testDebugSystem` and manual triggers).
- Resolved persistent "Maximum update depth exceeded" rendering loop related to `useStoryEngine` dependencies and state updates.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                | Impact    | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy                               |

| Cost Management     | High      | Medium     | Monitor API usage, implement rate limiting        |
| Content Safety      | Very High | Medium     | Strict prompt engineering, content filtering      |
| Generation Quality  | High      | Medium     | Refine prompts, add fallback mechanisms           |
| Storage Limitations | Medium    | High       | Minimize data stored, consider alternatives       |
