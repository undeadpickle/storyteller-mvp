# Comprehensive Coding Guidelines

## Core Development Principles
- Implement simple solutions over complex ones
- Only modify working code or UI when explicitly instructed
- Reuse existing components and avoid duplicating functionality
- Maintain clean, organized codebase structure (keep files under 300 lines)
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Always build in console logging to help with debugging
- Commit frequently to maintain reliable project history

## Implementation Approach
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns
- Remove old implementations when introducing alternatives to avoid duplication
- Break complex tasks into logical chunks with review points
- Implement solutions progressively rather than all at once
- Pause after completing meaningful components to verify requirements
- Choose minimal viable interpretation for ambiguous requirements

## Quality Assurance
- Write comprehensive tests for all new or modified functionality
- Identify potential edge cases and limitations
- Never unintentionally delete data or code; confirm before destructive actions
- Ensure UI changes are fully tested and validated
- Never override environment files without explicit confirmation

## Scope Management
- Classify proposed changes as Small, Medium, or Large
- Provide detailed implementation plans for significant changes
- Request permission before modifying components not specifically mentioned
- Identify when changes affect multiple components or systems

## Communication Protocol
- Always ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Summarize completed work and remaining tasks after each implementation phase
- Include usage examples for implemented components
- If my question/terminology seems incorrect, communicate this before suggesting code modifications
- Adjust interaction detail based on user preferences and task complexity

## User Interface Guidelines
- Never change or affect UI unintentionally
- Only alter UI components if explicitly instructed or clearly part of the assigned task
