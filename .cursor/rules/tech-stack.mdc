# StoryTeller MVP - Tech Stack (v1.2 - Dynamic Generation)

This document outlines the core technologies chosen for the StoryTeller MVP, now incorporating dynamic story generation. **Note:** This stack represents significantly increased complexity compared to a pre-written content approach.

## Core Frontend

* **Framework:** React (`latest` stable version, likely 18+)
* **Build Tool / Dev Server:** Vite (`latest` stable version)
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+) or TypeScript (TBD)
* **Package Manager:** npm or yarn

## State Management

* **Primary:** Zustand (`latest`) recommended due to increased asynchronous complexity. *(React Context API + `useReducer` is an alternative but may be harder to manage).*

## Styling

* **Method:** Tailwind CSS (`latest`) with shadcn/ui component system
* **Component Library:** shadcn/ui (based on Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS)
* **Utilities:** clsx, tailwind-merge for conditional styling

## AI Integrations & Orchestration

* **Text Generation:** Google AI Gemini API (or similar Text LLM)
* **Voice Generation:** ElevenLabs API
* **Interaction:** Custom logic (e.g., hooks, services) to manage calls between Text LLM -> ElevenLabs -> UI.
* **Access:** Via `Workspace` API or `axios`.

## Storage

* **Client-Side:** Browser `localStorage` (Primarily for profiles and minimal progress state like initiating prompt/theme. **Note:** Likely insufficient for saving full generated story state).
* **Backend/Database:** **None** for MVP (but limitations of `localStorage` are more critical now).

## Environment

* **Runtime:** Node.js (`latest` LTS version)
* **Platform:** Web Browser (targeting latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Key Considerations Added

* **Prompt Engineering:** Significant effort required to design and refine prompts for the Text LLM.
* **Safety Implementation:** Critical requirement for filtering/guardrails appropriate for children.
* **Latency Management:** UX design must account for delays from sequential AI API calls.
